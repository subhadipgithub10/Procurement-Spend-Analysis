**DESCRIPTIONS**
- Conducted a comprehensive data cleaning and analysis project focusing on procurement spend. Leveraged advanced Excel formulas and pivot tables to create an interactive dashboard for visualizing key metrics such as units sold, revenue, stock levels, supplier performance, and cost prices.

**STEPS**
- Cleaned and transformed procurement data using advanced Excel functions, improving data accuracy and usability.
- Developed an interactive dashboard using pivot tables and charts to visualize procurement data, including sales, revenue, and supplier performance.
- Utilized complex formulas to calculate new columns and metrics, enhancing data insights and reporting capabilities.
- Provided actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis, contributing to data-driven decision-making in procurement.

**INSIGHTS**
1. **Units Sold and Revenue**: Formal Wear had the highest units sold (1890 units) and generated the highest revenue (â‚¹111,821.82), indicating strong demand and profitability in this category. Accessories also showed substantial sales and revenue, while Casual Wear had the lowest figures.
2. **Monthly Revenue Trends**: The revenue showed fluctuations throughout the year, with a noticeable increase in December, suggesting potential seasonality in sales. This pattern could be due to holiday shopping or year-end purchases.
3. **Stock Levels**: The stock levels are highest for Formal Wear (18,724 units) and lowest for Casual Wear (15,119 units). This suggests a need to evaluate inventory management strategies, especially if these levels correlate with sales and demand trends.
4. **Supplier Performance and Cost Management**: The Supplier Performance and Cost Price per Product charts indicate variability in supplier efficiency and cost prices. This variability suggests an opportunity to review supplier contracts and negotiations to optimize costs and performance.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**
1. **Inventory Optimization**: Consider aligning stock levels more closely with sales trends to minimize holding costs and reduce the risk of overstocking or stockouts, particularly for categories with lower sales.
2. **Promotional Strategies**: Given the strong performance of Formal Wear, further promotional efforts could capitalize on this demand. Additionally, strategies to boost sales in the Casual Wear category should be explored.
3. **Seasonal Adjustments**: Plan for potential seasonal spikes in demand, particularly in December, to maximize revenue opportunities and ensure adequate stock levels.
4. **Supplier Review**: Conduct a detailed review of supplier performance and cost management. Streamlining suppliers and negotiating better terms could lead to cost savings and improved profitability.
